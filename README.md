## Features:

- **Telegram Bot**: Allows users to request a workout plan for a specific muscle group, and register the weights used for each exercise.
- **Google Sheets Integration**: Data for workout plans and weight tracking are stored in Google Sheets.
- **Google Apps Script**: Custom functions built to fetch workout plans based on muscle groups and register weights used for exercises.

## Components:

- **index.js**: This file contains the Telegram bot implementation using `Telegraf` and `node-fetch` packages to handle commands and actions from users.

- **app_script.gs**: This Google Apps Script file handles the backend functionality for fetching workout plans and registering weights in Google Sheets.

- **example_workout_sheet.xlsx**: Excel with one sheet storing workout plans categorized by muscle groups, detailing exercises, sets, and reps. And a second sheet logging weight used for exercises, along with timestamps.

#### Usage:

1. **Telegram Commands**:

   - `/start`: Initiates the bot and provides options to choose muscle groups (Back, Chest, Shoulders, Arms, Legs).
   - `/registerWeight <muscleGroup> <exercise> <weight>`: Registers the weight used for a specific exercise under a muscle group.

2. **Google Sheets Integration**:
   - The Google Apps Script (`app_script.gs`) fetches workout plans and registers weights based on HTTP requests from the Telegram bot.
   - `getPlan(muscleGroup)`: Retrieves the workout plan for the specified muscle group.
   - `registerWeight(muscleGroup, exercise, weight)`: Records the weight used for an exercise in the tracking sheet.

#### Setup:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   yarn install
   ```

3. Import the `example _workout_sheet.xlsx` to a Google sheet.

4. Deploy the Google Apps Script (`app_script.gs`) as a web app and obtain the URL.

5. Create a `telegram bot` and retrieve the Token provided.

6. Create a `config.js` file with your Telegram Bot Token (`BotToken`) and Google Apps Script Web App URL (`WebAppUrl`).

7. Run the Telegram bot:

   ```
   yarn start
   ```

8. Go to `Telegram` and initiate a conversation with the `username` you set to your bot.
